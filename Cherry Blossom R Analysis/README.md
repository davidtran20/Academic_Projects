# Cherry_Blossom_R_Analysis
The Cherry Blossom Ten Mile Run is held every year in Washington D.C, typically when the cherry flowers bloom. Since its first race in 1973,
the race has grown to nearly 17,000 runners as of 2012. The ages of the runners range from 9 to 89. The race data and results are made 
publically available on their website as seen in Figure 1. At the initial review of the race results, the data format does not seem to be 
consistent throughout 1999 to 2012. Some results per year have missing headers, missing values, and so on. As a part of the data cleansing 
and munging process, plots and basic statistics have been run in R for an analysis.
