# Times_Series_Case_Study-2

TThe purpose of this paper is to apply time series analysis techniques to financial applications. In this paper we demonstrate the use of Python libraries, such as NumPy, pandas, and matplotlib, to handle financial time series data. One of the challenges that arise when working with financial data is known as the data-alignment problem. This data-alignment problem occurs when two related time series may have indexes that don not line up perfectly (or when two DataFrame objects might have columns or row labels that don not match).

One type of analysis that we will demonstrate to solve this issue is to utilize the Python library, pandas, to automatically aligning data in arithmetic operations. We will analyze a simplified cross-sectional momentum portfolio and demonstrate how to set up a strategy backtesting function that computes a portfolio for a particular lookback and holding period to return the overall Sharpe ratio that can be used to predict prices for a portfolio of financial and technology stocks.
